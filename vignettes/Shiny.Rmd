## Automatic colors

To relay the color styling of your **shiny** to static R plots, just call `thematic_on()`. Although it's not required, it's best practice to also add `onStop(thematic_off)` (just in case R code that runs after the app doesn't want to use **thematic**):

```r
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(thematic)

thematic_on()
onStop(thematic_off)

shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    theme = shinythemes::shinytheme("darkly"),
    tabsetPanel(type = "pills",
      tabPanel("ggplot", plotOutput("ggplot")),
      tabPanel("lattice", plotOutput("lattice")),
      tabPanel("base", plotOutput("base"))
    )
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$ggplot <- renderPlot({
      ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, label = rownames(mtcars), color = factor(cyl))) +
        geom_point() +
        ggrepel::geom_text_repel()
    })
    output$lattice <- renderPlot(lattice::show.settings())
    output$base <- renderPlot({
      image(volcano, col = thematic_get_option("sequential"))
    })
  }
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/F6Ay1Oc.gif")
```

Although this particular app leverages **shinythemes** to style the app, **thematic** works regardless of _how_ the app is styled (by the way, the new **bootstraplib** package provides an exciting new alternative to **shinythemes** that soon will be our recommend way to style **shiny** apps). The magic is made possible through `shiny::getCurrentOutputInfo()`, which returns the relevant color and font information for the plot's HTML container. That means, if you wanted, you could style the plot's container in CSS and **thematic** would pick up those styles. For example, to change the bg/fg of the ggplot output, you could include the following in your UI definition:

```r
tags$style(HTML("#ggplot {color: aqua; 
background-color: purple }")))
```

And to change the accent color:

```r
# Change the link (i.e., accent) color
tags$style(HTML("#ggplot a {color: red}"))
```

By the way, if you're a **shiny** or **htmlwidget** developer, you can also take advantage of `shiny::getCurrentOutputInfo()` in your custom widgets (see [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/pull/2740) for more info).

## Rendering Google Fonts {#gfont-rendering}

Rendering of Google Fonts in **shiny** requires either **showtext** or **ragg** to be installed. **showtext** works with **shiny**'s default png device, so just make sure it's installed and add `library(showtext)` (to make sure deployment works as well).

```r
# install.packages("showtext")
library(showtext)
thematic_on(font = "Pacifico")
```

If you'd prefer to use **ragg** instead, which in some environments (especially hosted ones) can produce higher quality and consistent output in less time (see [here](https://ragg.r-lib.org/) for more details), do the following:

```r
# install.packages("ragg")
shinyOptions(shiny.device = ragg::agg_png)
```


## Auto font rendering {#auto-rendering}

In the event that your app uses a Google Font (or a font family that is already known to R), you can turn on auto fonts without thinking twice:

```r
thematic_on(font = "auto")
```

By the way, if you're curious, to use a Google Font (e.g [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico)), you *can* import the fonts remotely this way; however, it's recommended to use local font files (for hosting reasons). The [**gfonts** package](https://github.com/dreamRs/gfonts) makes it really easy to download and use Google Fonts locally.

```r
tags$link(href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Pacifico", rel="stylesheet")
```

```r
tags$style(HTML("body{font-family: Pacifico}"))
```
