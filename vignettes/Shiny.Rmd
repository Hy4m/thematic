## Automatic colors

To relay the color styling of your **shiny** to static R plots, just call `thematic_on()`. Although it's not required, it's best practice to also add `onStop(thematic_off)` (just in case R code that runs after the app doesn't want to use **thematic**):

```r
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(thematic)

thematic_on()
onStop(thematic_off)

shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    theme = shinythemes::shinytheme("darkly"),
    tabsetPanel(type = "pills",
      tabPanel("ggplot", plotOutput("ggplot")),
      tabPanel("lattice", plotOutput("lattice")),
      tabPanel("base", plotOutput("base"))
    )
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$ggplot <- renderPlot({
      ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, label = rownames(mtcars), colour = factor(cyl))) +
        geom_point() +
        ggrepel::geom_text_repel()
    })
    output$lattice <- renderPlot(lattice::show.settings())
    output$base <- renderPlot({
      image(volcano, col = thematic_get_option("sequential"))
    })
  }
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

Although this particular app leverages **shinythemes** to style the app, **thematic** works regardless of _how_ the app is styled (by the way, the new **bootstraplib** package provides an exciting new alternative to **shinythemes** that soon will be our recommend way to style **shiny** apps). The magic is made possible through `shiny::getCurrentOutputInfo()`, which returns the relevant color and font information for the plot's HTML container. That means, if you wanted, you could style the plot's container in CSS and **thematic** would pick up those styles. For example, to change the bg/fg of the ggplot output, you could include the following in your UI definition:

```r
tags$style(HTML("#ggplot {color: aqua; 
background-color: purple }")))
```

And to change the accent color:

```r
# Change the link (i.e., accent) color
tags$style(HTML("#ggplot a {color: red}"))
```

By the way, if you're a **shiny** or **htmlwidget** developer, you can also take advantage of `shiny::getCurrentOutputInfo()` in your custom widgets (see [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/pull/2740) for more info).

## Rendering Google Fonts {#gfont-rendering}

Rendering of Google Fonts in **shiny** requires either **showtext** or **ragg** to be installed. **showtext** works with **shiny**'s default png device, so just make sure it's installed and add `library(showtext)` (to make sure deployment works as well).

```r
# install.packages("showtext")
library(showtext)
thematic_on(font = "Pacifico")
```

If you'd prefer to use **ragg** instead, which in some environments (especially hosted ones) can produce higher quality and consistent output in less time (see [here](https://ragg.r-lib.org/) for more details), do the following:

```r
# install.packages("ragg")
shinyOptions(shiny.device = ragg::agg_png)
```


## Auto font rendering {#auto-rendering}

In the unlikely event that your app uses a font family that is already known to R, you can turn on auto fonts without thinking twice:

```r
thematic_on(font = "auto")
```

In the more likely event that your app uses a Google Font, and R can render Google Fonts (see above section), then you can also turn on auto fonts. For exanple, by adding the two following lines to the app's UI and enabling auto fonts, we get the following result 

```r
tags$link(href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Pacifico", rel="stylesheet")
```

```r
tags$style(HTML("body{font-family: Pacifico}"))
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/eWXYtis.gif")
```
